It was a good way to learn more about Machine Learning in Python by creating these notebooks. I created some of the figures/tables of the chapters and worked through some LAB sections. At certain points I realize that it may look like I tried too hard to make the output identical to the tables and R-plots in the book. But I did this to explore some details of the libraries mentioned above (mostly matplotlib and seaborn). Suggestions for improvement and help with unsolved issues are welcome!
