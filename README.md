This repository contains Python code for a selection of tables, figures and LAB sections from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R" by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013).<P>

Chapter 3 - Linear Regression<BR>
Chapter 4 - Classification<BR>
Chapter 5 - Resampling Methods<BR>
Chapter 6 - Linear Model Selection and Regularization<BR>
Chapter 7 - Moving Beyond Linearity<BR>
Chapter 8 - Tree-Based Methods<BR>
Chapter 9 - Support Vector Machines<BR>
Chapter 10 - Unsupervised Learning<P>

It was a good way to learn more about Machine Learning in Python by creating these notebooks. I created some of the figures/tables of the chapters and worked through some LAB sections. At certain points I realize that it may look like I tried too hard to make the output identical to the tables and R-plots in the book. But I did this to explore some details of the libraries mentioned above (mostly matplotlib and seaborn). Suggestions for improvement and help with unsolved issues are welcome!
